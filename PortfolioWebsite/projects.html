        <p>
          Blazor web application designed strictly for mobile devices for the mechanical contracting company I interned at in Summer 2024.
          Built up my knowledge on C#, HTML, and CSS as well as Oracle and SQL database queries. Unfortunately, due to company confidentiality,
          I am unable to showcase the software, but the overall gist of it was to give foreman out on jobsites the ability to check-in what parts
          have or have not been received at the site.
