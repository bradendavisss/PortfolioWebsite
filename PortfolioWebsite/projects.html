      <h3>Order Check In App</h3>
      <p>
        Blazor web application designed strictly for mobile devices for the mechanical contracting company I interned at in Summer 2024.
        Built up my knowledge on <a class="tech">C#</a>,
        <a class="tech">HTML</a>, and <a class="tech">CSS</a>
        as well as <a class="tech">SQL</a> database queries. Unfortunately, due to company confidentiality,
        I am unable to showcase the software, but the overall gist of it was to give foremen out on job sites the ability to check-in what parts
        have or have not been received at the site.

      <h3>Personal Finance APp</h3>
      <p>The project that I am currently working on is a personal finance app designed specifically for college students who want to learn to become financially literate.
        Investing and saving is a very important skill to teach kids, and I want to make it easier for them. With this app, I can do that.

    Over the summer of 2024, at my internship, was my first time really getting familiar with a graphical interface
    and I plan on doing more projects with GUIs as my coding career in college continues.
